## Online experiments

We use [Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org) to host PsychoJS experiments, created with [PsychoPy Builder](https://www.psychopy.org/). There are some stand-alone experiments, but here we put up links to 

### Go-NoGo
Measures impulse control, as well as processing time. This task involves refraining from responding to 20% “No-Go” stimuli, embedded in 80% "Go" stimuli.
