## Online experiments

We use [Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org) to host PsychoJS experiments, created with [PsychoPy Builder](https://www.psychopy.org/). Following is a list of "standard" tasks we use in a battery aimed to gauge a wide variety of cognitive and sensorimotor function:

### Go-NoGo
Measures impulse control, as well as processing time. This task involves refraining from responding to 20% “No-Go” stimuli, embedded in 80% "Go" stimuli.

### N-back
Measures working memory and working memory capacity; it requires participants to indicate whether the current stimulus matches the one from “N” (here 1, 2 or 3) steps earlier in the sequence.
