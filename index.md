## Online experiments

We use [Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org) to host PsychoJS experiments, created with [PsychoPy Builder](https://www.psychopy.org/). Following is a list of "standard" tasks we use in a battery aimed to gauge a wide variety of cognitive and sensorimotor function:

### Go-NoGo
Measures impulse control, as well as processing time. This task involves refraining from responding to 20% “No-Go” stimuli, embedded in 80% "Go" stimuli.

### N-back
Measures working memory and working memory capacity; it requires participants to indicate whether the current stimulus matches the one from “N” (here 1, 2 or 3) steps earlier in the sequence.

### Mirror Reversed Reaching
Measures inhibition as well as _de novo_ learning, as opposed to adapting existing visuo-motor maps. It involves reaching targets with a cursor that is mirror-reversed (i.e. cursor moves left when moving the mouse right).

### Task Switching
Measures the cost of switching from one task to another, both in reaction time and accuracy. It compares performance between switch trials and repeat trials, as well between a task-switching block and single-task blocks.

### Visual Search
Measures top-down attentional processes incolved in serial search. This task involves indicating if the target letter “T” is present among 6, 12 or 18 symbols (such as L’s) or not (50% - 50%).
