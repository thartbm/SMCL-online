## Online experiments

We use [Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org) to host PsychoJS experiments, created with [PsychoPy Builder](https://www.psychopy.org/). Following is a list of "standard" tasks we use in a battery aimed to gauge a wide variety of cognitive and sensorimotor function:

### Go-NoGo
Measures impulse control, as well as processing time. This task involves refraining from responding to 20% “No-Go” stimuli, embedded in 80% "Go" stimuli.

### N-back
Measures working memory and working memory capacity; it requires participants to indicate whether the current stimulus matches the one from “N” (here 1, 2 or 3) steps earlier in the sequence.

### Reversed Reaching
Measures action inhibition and cognitive control of movement. It involves reaching targets with a cursor that is mirror-reversed (i.e. cursor moves left when moving the mouse right).

### Task Switching
Measures the cost of switching from one task to another, both in reaction time and accuracy. It compares performance between switch trials and repeat trials, as well between a task-switching block and single-task blocks.

### Visual Search
Measures top-down attentional processes incolved in serial search. This task involves indicating if the target letter “T” is present among 6, 12 or 18 symbols (such as L’s) or not (50% - 50%).

### Tunneling
Measures visuomotor acuity by having participants quickly navigating a cursor (by moving a mouse) along a narrow-curved tunnel without touching the edges. Here we look at the speed-accuracy trade-off in this skilled task.

### TrailMaking
A common neuropsychological tool, assessing multiple processes such as visual search, speed of processing, mental flexibility, as well as executive functioning. Participants move a mouse cursor from 1 to 9 and A to I, interleaved: 1-A-2-B-.. etc.

### Iowa Gambling Task

A popular task in cognitive psychology to measure decision making and executive function in the face of uncertainty. Pick a card from 1 of 4 decks, all of them always give a reward, but there are sometimes also losses of various size.
